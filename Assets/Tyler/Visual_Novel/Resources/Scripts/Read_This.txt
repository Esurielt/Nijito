Use Dialogue Parser2 and Dialogue Box1
Background formatting, size, etc, not covered that much. 


USE SCENE4, that is the most up to date one. 


Dialogue Parser2-reads in a text file from a specified path/folder/text.txt
	this will read the following kind of line
	Name, "Content", Pose(a number/position of the sprite in its folder), orientation((L or R))
	ex.
	Ibuki,"Hello, there.",0,L
	Miku,"Did the player just get <color=green>rick rolled</color>?", 0,L

	Auto set to Dialogue3.txt in using PATH = Assets/Tyler/Visual_Novel/Resources/Dialogue/ + filename;  filename=Dialogue3.txt line 110

1.Load images, line 72- PATH TO LOAD SPRITES. Unfortunately uses loadResources, so ADDED folder Tyler/Sprites/Ibuki,Miku, etc to RESOURCES FOldER
this function loads the sprites from a folder, expected to have a folder labeled sprite name to contain the sprite poses(0,1,2,...)
2.Load Dialogue-line 110- PATH TO DIALOGUE TEXT.,this function loads the dialogue turning them into variables to be read. 




DialogueBox1
	THis script reads information from DialogueParser2, and will "Create the Sprites, images, textbox, etc"
	If you are going to change formatting position, padding, etc this is it. 
	In the Dialogue Box Object, this will have in the script component of DialoguBox1, the customstyle and custom styleName. The first is for the text box, and the later is for the name box. You can edit the padding, font, etc here.

1.SetSpritePositions function-line 82-Here you can create new Orientations!
2.OnGUI functions-line 96,120- Here you can also edit the the text and name box. 
3.DisplayImage-displays the sprite given from pose variable from the parser script/ the part of the line in the text file noted as POSE
4.ResetImage-deletes images when click so new images can be created. 

also, you must provide the text box image, ie the borders,in the DialogueBoxObject, in the script component,  in the customstyle then click Normal, and also in customstylename then click Normal. 




On Main Camera, a script called AspectFix1 is added, this will add black columns if Aspect Ratio does not fit nicely. 

also, dont forget to add objects to scenes, empty, but one to hold dialogue parser, and one for dialogue box.
