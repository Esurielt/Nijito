This is not where song data goes in the long term, this is just a home folder so the songs can be traded on GitHub.

To use these songs, copy the folder to your own 'Song Data' directory, which is created by the beatmap editor when you first run it.

Default location on Windows 10 is [your main drive] > Users > [your user account] > AppData > LocalLow > Nijito Development Team > Nijito > Song Data
